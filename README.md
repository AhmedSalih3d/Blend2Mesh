# Blend2Mesh
Blend2Mesh is a simple add-on written in Python, which allows the user to fast and effectively export different Blender geometries to binary files, which allows for fast reading/loading in external programs. This tool works on any mesh inside of Blender, but will not work for curves etc. It has to be a mesh object.

# Installation and Use
Installing this tool is fairly easy. Download "Blend2Mesh" and save it somewhere  on your computer. Then open Blender, in the top left corner, "Edit" -> "Preferences" -> "Add-ons". In this new window which has been opened, press "Install" and locate the downloaded file. After this has been done search for "Blend2Mesh" and tick the check box to make the add-on available for use. Now when working in Blender it is possible, either by clicking the "Object" button and find "Blend2Mesh" option or by pressing F3 and searching for the "Blend2Mesh"
command. Remember, this will only work with meshes so have one selected before hand - also files will be output where the blend file is saved.
